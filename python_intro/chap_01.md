# Chapter 1: Getting Started
        
To get started with Python, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and set up a development environment using an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment using Anaconda and run your first Python program.

In this chapter, we will cover how to set up your environment for coding in Python. There are multiple ways to setup python in your local environment. If you are using a Mac or Ubuntu, python comes installed by default, albeit it could be an older version. Irrespective of that, we recommend the following steps to properly setup your local python environment. 

1. Install python using the Anaconda distribution*
2. Install Visual Studio Code
    * You can also use the miniconda distribution if you prefer a lighter installation.

We recommend installing the anaconda distribution, which includes Python and many useful libraries for science and data analysis.    You can download it from the official website: [Anaconda Download](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

Visual Studio Code is a powerful code editor that supports Python development. You can download it from the official website: [Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### <span style='color:blue'>Setting Up Your First Python Project

Once you have installed Python and Visual Studio Code, you can create your first Python project. Follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Create a new folder for your project
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Create a new file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `main.py`)
5. Type print('Hello, World!') in the file

    > ```python
    > # This will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
    > 
    > print('Hello, World!')
    > ```

6. Save the file
7. Run the file by opening the terminal in Visual Studio Code and typing 
        
    > ```python
    > # To execute the program and see the result, type the below command
    > # in the terminal window or click the "Run Python file" button on the
    > # top right corner of the code window
    > ```
    > $ python main.py
    >
