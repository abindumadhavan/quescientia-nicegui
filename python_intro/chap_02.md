# Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types
        
In Python, variables are used to store data. You can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it. Python supports various data types including strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
        
##### Exploring Python Basics

In this chapter, we will explore the basic concepts of Python programming, including variables, data types, and control structures.

##### Variables and Data Types

1. Variables are used to store data in Python. You can create a variable by assigning a value to it. For example:

    > x = 5  
    > \# This creates a variable x and assigns it the value 5
    >
    > y = 'Hello'  
    > \# This creates a variable y and assigns it the string 'Hello'
    > 
    > z = 3.14  
    > \# This creates a variable z and assigns it the float value 3.14

2. Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function:

    > print(type(x))  
    > \# This will output: \<class 'int'\>
    > 
    > print(type(y))  
    > \# This will output: \<class 'str'\>
    > 
    > print(type(z))  
    > \# This will output: \<class 'float'\>

3. You can also perform operations on variables. For example, you can add two numbers or concatenate two strings:

    > a = 10
    > 
    > b = 20
    > 
    > sum\_ab = a + b  
    > \# This will add the two numbers
    > 
    > print(sum\_ab)  
    > \# Output: 30
    > 
    > name = 'Alice'
    > 
    > greeting = 'Hello, ' + name  
    > \# This will concatenate the two strings
    > 
    > print(greeting)  
    > \# Output: Hello, Alice
